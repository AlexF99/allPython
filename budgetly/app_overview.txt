budgeting app requisits:

-in iterface will have basically the simplest dashboard with the money the user has now, a button to add an expense and one to add money to the current amount (salary, investments, freelance money)

-whenever the user clicks the add button to add an expense, it will open a screen with the categories or an option to start a new one

-there should be an option to check where the money was spent, how much was spent (should probably count days, months or whatever time frame)

DATABASE: mysql db containing the action objects, all these inside user objects, so the user will have a log of all actions theyve made on their "current"

there's 2 big challenges in buiding this app: one of them is using oop correctly or at least making it work, the second being conneting it to a database safely ad correctly.

there's another big one that is making it all one executable file, I havent figured what that looks like yet

****there's pretty much functions that creates and verifies users, and functions that make changes to the users' current amount of money

*****research a way not to use float as the datatype for money like decimal

      saldo




gasto     ganho

----------------


criar duas subclasses a partir da classe Action: gasto e ganho, um com membro de classe tipo = 0 e outro = 1

workflow from now on:

-start commiting changes to github repository
-learn how to use db's
-refine oop proper usage
-define system design pattern
-do the above while learning
-remember to organize files and modules
-make it a desktop app first, so i can launch it quickly





for frontend:

-app returns layout, this first one has to be root widget, it is the root of screen, which can have multiple layouts in itself
-each layout can have multiple widgets
